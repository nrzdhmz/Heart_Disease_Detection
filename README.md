# Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease using the **Heart Disease UCI** dataset from Kaggle: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data).  

We implemented three models:  
- Logistic Regression (tuned for F1-Score)  
- Random Forest (tuned)  
- Gradient Boosting  

The models are evaluated using **Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC AUC**, with confusion matrices for each.
